### Setup MongoDB via MongoDB Atlas
1. [Create an Atlas Account](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/create-atlas-account/#create-an-service-account)
2. [Deploy a Free Tier Cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/)
3. [Whitelist Your Connection IP Address](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/whitelist-connection-ip-address/)
4. [Create a MongoDB User for Your Cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster/)

Once your Cluster and MongoDB User are created, you can get your **Connection String** from the Connect Menu, and add it to your `.env` file. See [Connect Your Application](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/driver-connection/#connect-your-application) for more
information.
